## Exercise 1
Write a program <code>Stairs.java</code> which prints the following stairs to the terminal:

<pre>
            +---+
            |   |
        +---+---+
        |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
</pre>

## Exercise 2

Open the file <code>Errors.java</code> with VSCode and correct the errors.

Line 12 reads <code>Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in)</code>.
This statement creates a <code>Scanner</code> object that can be used
to read data from a stream (allow the user to enter some information into the program). In this case it will read from the standard
input stream (your keyboard).

## Exercise 3

Write a program <code>Faces.java</code> which prints at least 2 faces next to each other, consisting of
ASCII characters <u>only</u>, to the terminal. You can find a table of all ASCII characters <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html>here</a>.

#### Example:
<pre>
   ////            \|||/
 | o  o |        |       |
(|      |)      <  *   *  >
 |  \/  |        |  . .  |
 | \__/ |        |  ===  |
  ------         \_______/
</pre>

Make your own faces different from the examples. In this case the output is supposed to look different.
