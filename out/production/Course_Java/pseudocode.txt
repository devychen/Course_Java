ex1. pseudocode


case 1. wrong if input xml is null or empty

case 2. wrong if the xml string not start with "<" or end with ">",
or other strange beginning/ending

the general case:
- let's read from the beginning;
- detect the begin-tag by locating "<" and ">", add to stack as the element "begin-tag";
- keep reading, until find the next pair of "<" and ">";
- if shortly follow "<" is /, then this could be the end-tag;
- add to stack as the end element.
Compare if the content of begin-tag = end-tag, case-sensitive;
-
