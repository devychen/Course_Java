The following code compiles but does not always work correctly:

```java
int countWords2(File aFile) throws FileNotFoundException {
int ret = 0;
    try (
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(aFile);
    ) {
        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
            scanner.next();
            ret++;
        }
    }
    return ret;
}
```

Please mark and fix the error.
