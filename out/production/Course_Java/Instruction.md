## Exercise 1

Write a class `Patient` that extends `Person`. You will need to create the `Patient.java`. Don't forget to add it to your Git repo.

The Patient class should add a feature 'social security number' to Person. The 'social security number' must have a format ddd-dd-dddd where each 'd' stands for a digit. (You don't have to check for the format.)

Please implement all methods in the documentation. Once again, you can find the documentation in the Doc file of your repo. The file name is Patient.html (Open from your local file in your browser). Be sure to read the entire documentation before you start to make your program sketch. It is important that you use the correct method names and the correct parameters to every method.

Hint: Don't forget to use `super`. Consult the slides if you're not sure when to use super.

We recomend writing tests, but they will not be graded this time.
