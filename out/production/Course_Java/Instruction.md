<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>
Clone this repository to your computer. From there, open the file <tt>LoveHate.java</tt> to complete this task.  

Unfortunately the Java Code Eater Virus has removed most of the code from the program. Please, reconstruct it with the help of the comments of the program (which fortunately have been spared by the virus).

**(3 points)**

<h2> Exercise 2 </h2>

Create a program <tt>Words.java</tt> which reads three words and prints the input as following:

- The first word in capital letters
- The second word in lower case letters
- The first two characters of the third word (we assume that the third word is always at least two characters long)

**Example output:**
<pre>
Enter three words: Hello lovely world

Word one as upper case: HELLO
Second word as lower case: lovely
First two characters of word three: wo
</pre>
