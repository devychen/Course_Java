# Lab 8
The deadline is **16:00 on Friday, 21 June**. Submissions later than this time will be 
ignored. Be sure to push your commits before the deadline.


## Exercise 1

Please complete the missing code in the `BinaryTree` class. You will also need `BinaryTreeNode`.

The code that is missing refers to the following methods :

*   `public boolean contains (T targetElement)` - Check if the tree contains the target element
*   `public T find(T targetElement)` - Find and return an element in the tree
*   `public Iterator iteratorInOrder()` - Performs an inorder traversal
*   `public Iterator iteratorPreOrder()` - Performs an preorder traversal
*   `public Iterator iteratorPostOrder()` - Performs a postorder traversal

**Note:** Some of these methods might require helper methods to perform the actual task.
