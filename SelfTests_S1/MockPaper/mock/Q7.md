The **ArrayFilter** class has a static method

`public static Object[] map(AFMapper afMapper,Object[] values)`

which applies the AFMapper instance to all elements in values. Write a class

`AFFirstCharToUpperCaseMapper`

which turns the first character of the String representation to uppercase. The rest of the String representation must not be altered. Your class should be usable as an argument to the afMapper parameter.

Example:

```
"hello" -> "Hello"

1 -> "1"
```
